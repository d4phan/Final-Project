    <h1>Are Temperate Coastal Zones Entering a New Era of "Dry Heat"?</h1>
    <p>Explore how climate change is reshaping the coasts through interactive data visualization.</p>

    <h2>What is "Dry Heat"?</h2>
    <p>Dry heat means high temperatures with little humidity or rainfall. Historically rare on coasts, but is that changing?</p>
  </section>

  <section id="data" class="scroll-section">
    <h2>Historical vs. Predicted Data (1850-2100)</h2>
    <div id="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">Notice the sharp rise in temperature after 2000, with precipitation staying nearly flat. <strong>Predicted data (2025-2100) is essential</strong> to understand future climate trajectories.</p>

    <h2>Regional Focus: Southern California & East Coast</h2>
    <div id="regional-charts"></div>
    <p><strong>Southern California Coast</strong> is projected to enter a "dry heat" era by 2100 with >3°C warming and minimal precipitation change.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conclusion" class="scroll-section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Some temperate coastal zones are indeed entering a new era of "dry heat"—especially in the American West. This has major implications for ecosystems, water resources, and human communities.</p>
